## Top-Down Estimation
Top-down estimation involves breaking the project into high-level components and estimating the effort required for each.

### High-Level Components
- **User Authentication and Management**: Allow users to log in and manage sessions.
- **Document Management**: Create, open, save, and close documents.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Allow multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle conflicts when two users edit the same part of the document.
- **Console Interface**: Develop a user-friendly console-based interface.
- **Testing and Debugging**: Test the application and fix bugs.

### Effort Estimation
| Component                | Estimated Effort (Days) |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| User Authentication     | 3                      |
| Document Management     | 4                      |
| Real-Time Collaboration | 6                      |
| Conflict Resolution     | 5                      |
| Console Interface       | 4                      |
| Testing and Debugging   | 4                      |
| **Total**               | **26**                 |

#### Tasks to Do This Week:
- Completed user authentication and session management.

#### Potential Problems:
- Ensuring smooth real-time updates without performance issues.


##### Training
  - get your current ipv4
  - run and compile server file with your ipv4
  - do the same for client
  - After creating or editing file, you need to save otherwise you'll lose your updates


### System Requirements
